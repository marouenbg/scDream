In order to get the results of the final submission, you can run the code/analaysis.r script.
The full set of files and data is also available at https://github.com/marouenbg/scDream

All you have to do to obtain the submission results is to run analysis.r, I have set the parameters to those of the last submission. There is a number of required packages that you will need to install but that is about it.

code/submission.r script has the code to perform the final submission and its corresponding files.
