Some thoughts:

-can't binarize to 0,1,2 because levels of reference genes are pre-determined (or it would be complicated to match the gene units)
-use Seurat to determine clusters and find high variable genes in those clusters
-Try mapping with: Seurat and DistMap and the other tool

#what is DV

-possibly: tnse clusters + 
-contrqtive PCA since it conserves geographical location but : -python / -requires background data
-Think of it as puzzle: find cells minimally distant in euclidean distance
