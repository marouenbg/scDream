Some thoughts:

-can't binarize to 0,1,2 because levels of reference genes are pre-determined (or it would be complicated to match the gene units)
-use Seurat to determine clusters and find high variable genes in those clusters
-Try mapping with: Seurat and DistMap and the other tool
-Try with Seurat but with binarization of DistMap

#Questions
#what is DV

-possibly: tnse clusters + 
-contrqtive PCA since it conserves geographical location but : -python / -requires background data
-Think of it as puzzle: find cells minimally distant in euclidean distance


Fixes to Seurat:
-tanspose in rbind FitGeneK (Could this be fixed by trqnspoing insitu.matrix ? to have it similar to raw.matrix as genes per cells)
-replace grep escape character in subset column in FitGeneK
